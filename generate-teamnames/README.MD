# How does it work
It takes Example/input_filenames.txt as data input; Each line represents a different teamname. A Word document is generated where every line of the inputfile is printed on a different page.

# Todo list:
- Add parameters to executable:
	- [Required] Input filename
	- [Optional] Output filename
- Calculate the desired fontsize according to the teamnames length

- Wishlist: 
	- Add Excel input filename with location of teamname and teamnumber
